# AHB-to-APB-Bridge-Design

## Overview

This repository contains the design and implementation of an AHB to APB bridge. The bridge facilitates communication between the Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) and the Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB), enabling efficient integration of high-performance system modules with low-power peripheral devices.

## About AMBA Buses

The Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) is a communication protocol designed for high-performance embedded microcontrollers. It includes:

- **Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB)**: Designed for high-performance, high-frequency system modules.
- **Advanced System Bus (ASB)**: Suitable for applications where AHBâ€™s high-performance features are not required.
- **Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)**: Optimized for low-power peripherals with reduced interface complexity.

### Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB)

The AHB acts as the backbone for high-performance system modules, connecting processors, memories, and external memory interfaces efficiently. It supports low-power peripheral functions and is optimized for synthesis and automated testing.

### Advanced System Bus (ASB)

The ASB offers an alternative to AHB, designed for cases where extreme performance is not necessary but still provides efficient connections with processors and memory systems.

### Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)

APB is tailored for low-power peripheral functions. It simplifies the interface and reduces power consumption, working in conjunction with AHB or ASB for comprehensive system integration.

## Basic Terminology

- **Bus Cycle**: A basic unit of one bus clock period, defined from rising-edge to rising-edge transitions.
- **Bus Transfer**: A read or write operation of a data object, which may span multiple bus cycles. APB transfers always require two cycles.
- **Burst Operation**: A series of data transactions with consistent width over an address space. APB does not support burst operations.

## Implementation

### Objective

The project aims to design and simulate a synthesizable AHB to APB bridge using Verilog. The bridge translates AHB system bus transfers into APB transfers and performs essential functions, including:

- Latching and holding addresses valid throughout the transfer.
- Address decoding and generating the peripheral select signals (`PSELx`).
- Driving data onto the APB for write operations and from APB for read operations.
- Generating the timing strobe `PENABLE` for APB transfers.

### Basic Implementation Tools

- **HDL Used**: Verilog
- **Simulator Tool**: ModelSim
- **Synthesis Tool**: Quartus Prime
- **Family**: Cyclone V
- **Device**: 5CSXFC6D6F31I7ES

### Design Modules

#### AHB Slave Interface

The AHB slave responds to transfers initiated by the AHB bus master. It uses the `HSELx` select signal to determine when it should respond to a transfer, relying on address and control signals from the master.

#### APB Controller

The APB controller consists of a state machine for generating APB and AHB output signals, and address decoding logic for generating `PSELx` lines for peripheral selection.

## Simulation Results

The simulation demonstrates successful mapping of AHB bus operations to the APB bus, including both write and read operations.

## Further Work

- Extend functionality to support burst read and write operations in the AHB Master.
- Implement an arbitration mechanism and associated signals to generalize the testbench.
